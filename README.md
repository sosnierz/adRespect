<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
The project was based on mapping the design of the adRespect software company. The project was written with JavaScript, SCSS and HTML. The following libraries were used in the project: Bootstrap, SplideJS, MacyJS.
The bootstrap library was not fully implemented due to the fact that in the project the arrangement of containers at 1440px resolution was different from the library's value. In my opinion, it was easier and faster to map the position of elements by applying styles to them than to overwrite library values.
In addition, due to the fact that the project was based on a resolution of 1440px and did not give guidelines as to the appearance of elements both above this value and the resolution for mobile devices, I made the layout responsive according to my own sense of aesthetics.
Also a popup showing photos in the gallery, although written by me, can be replaced with a ready-made library (e.g. lightgallery), but I did not decide on this solution here.
